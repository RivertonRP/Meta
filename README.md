# RivertonRP Meta
Hello and welcome to the Riverton Meta GitHub repository! This is where you can **report bugs** and **suggest new features and improvements** for RivertonRP! You can also join discussions about feature requests and bug reports.

We want to improve communication with our users by providing official channels for reporting problems and sharing ideas. This space will be used to determine whether you are comfortable reporting and tracking your issues using this tool. This document (known as the README) will serve as a jumping-off point for creating your first issue.

## General Introduction
The RivertonRP Meta GitHub repository can be found here. Here, you can tell us about features and ideas you'd like to see added to RivertonRP, as well as report bugs that need to be fixed. To track bug reports and feature requests, we use GitHub's Issue Tracker feature (suggestions).

We understand you may be new to GitHub, and that's perfectly fine! We'll do our best to assist you in navigating this tracker. We can begin by introducing some key terms that you will hear frequently:
- **Issue**: A feature request or **bug** report.
- **Repository** or **repo**: Refers to the group of RivertonRP Meta pages. Includes the **issue** tracker and documents (like this one).
- **Bug**: Any piece of unintended behaviour anywhere on Riverton. Basically, if something isn't working how it should, it's a bug.
- **Valid**: If an **issue** is correct. Reproducible? Correct information? Actually an issue?
- **Reproducible**: If a **bug** report can be copied or induced by other people. A bug report must be **reproducible** to be **valid**.

You're one step closer to creating your first issue now that you're an expert on the technical jargon we use to manage issues!

## Community Expectations
We expect members of the community who participate in these discussions to be civil and to keep this forum productive and enjoyable. Users who violate the rules will have their messages deleted and, depending on the circumstances, may be permanently barred from participating.

### Do
- Make use of the issue templates provided.
- Assist staff as needed
- Participate in ongoing discussions
- Provide ideas with constructive feedback.
- Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue has not already been submitted before making a new post (use the search bar on the [Issues page](https://github.com/RivertonRP/Meta/issues))
- Verify the validity of your issue
- Be clear, concise and specific in your messages
- Keep conversations on-topic
- Be respectful toward everyone
- Take advantage of [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) -- it's awesome, and it makes your submission that much better! 😄
- Create a separate issue for each feature request/bug report (don't talk about multiple things in one issue)

### Don't
- Bump issues for the sole purpose of receiving a response (all issues are acknowledged)
- Argue unproductively in the comments
- Stray off-topic
- Try to get support for RivertonRP here
- Use logical fallacies in arguments
- Recreate an issue you feel was unjustly closed -- if you feel an issue was unjustly closed, feel free to add a comment to the issue explaining why
- Add comments such as 👍, +1, or "I like this idea" -- use [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)! We can measure those :)
